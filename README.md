# Math-Rapids-Alpha
Project Members: Christian Viazzo, Zachary Sadaghiani, Kenneth Smith

When you select 'Play" go to the 'Easy' tab. It's the only world that currently has code.
This version is in an extremely alpha state and does not do much. At the moment the world generates with an
equation and the answer. If you select the answer it will disappear and nothing else will happen. That
is it.
